# Server & Client Communication
###### Created by Emir Yorgun

This project demonstrates multithreading with **pthreads**, process **forking**, and **socket programming** to create **a synchronized** server & client communication system. It ensures proper synchronization between threads using mutexes and condition variables.

------------
- **Multithreading:** *Utilizes pthreads to create two threads that increment a shared variable A in a synchronized manner.*
- **Process Forking:** *Demonstrates process creation using fork(), with separate execution paths for the parent and child processes.*
-   **Socket Programming:** *Implements a server that listens for client connections, receives messages, and responds with the current value of A.*
-   **Synchronization:** *Uses mutexes and condition variables to ensure proper synchronization between threads.*
